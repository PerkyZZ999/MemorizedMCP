## Requirements Compliance Review

Source: `docs/Requirements.md`

### Scope
This document lists requirements that are not met or only partially met by the current implementation.

---

### Functional Requirements — Unmet/Partial

- Memory: Search (multi‑modal vector/graph/text with fusion)
  - Status: Partial
  - Notes: `memory.search` performs substring with temporal/episode filters. Hybrid fusion exists in `/search/fusion`, but it does not include vector or graph scoring yet.

- Memory: Update (versioning, re‑embedding, index refresh)
  - Status: Partial
  - Notes: `memory.update` updates JSON; no version counter, no re‑embedding, no text/vector/graph index refresh.

- Memory: Delete (safe removal, dependency checks, cascading cleanup, backup)
  - Status: Partial
  - Notes: Deletes the record; no dependency checks, no cascade across indices/KG, no backup step.

- Document: Retrieve by path
  - Status: Unmet
  - Notes: `document.retrieve` supports `id`/`hash` but not `path`.

- Document: Analyze (key concepts, summaries, reference linking)
  - Status: Partial
  - Notes: Returns entities; key concepts empty, summary null, no explicit reference linking output.

- System: Backup/Restore
  - Status: Unmet
  - Notes: HTTP endpoints for `system.backup` and `system.restore` are not implemented.

- Advanced: Analyze Patterns
  - Status: Unmet
  - Notes: No endpoint/logic for `advanced.analyze_patterns`.

- Advanced: Reindex (vector/text/graph)
  - Status: Unmet
  - Notes: No endpoint/logic for `advanced.reindex`.

---

### Non‑Functional Requirements — Unmet/Partial

- Performance: Vector ANN index operational (HNSW)
  - Status: Partial
  - Notes: Vector index scaffold/metadata exists; actual HNSW search is not wired into queries.

- Observability: Metrics and dashboards
  - Status: Unmet
  - Notes: Structured logging exists; no metrics collection/export or dashboards.

- Reliability: Backpressure/circuit breakers; integrity checks; recoverable ops
  - Status: Partial
  - Notes: Cleanup/maintenance jobs exist; no explicit backpressure, circuit breakers, or integrity validation on recovery.

- Security & Privacy: Input validation and resource limits
  - Status: Partial
  - Notes: Local‑first stance is implemented; input validation and resource limiting are minimal.

---

### Environment & Setup — Unmet/Partial

- BACKUP_DIR usage
  - Status: Unmet
  - Notes: Documented in guides, but not used by implemented backup/restore (which are missing).

---

### Acceptance Criteria — Unmet/Partial

- Query fusion with temporal filters
  - Status: Partial
  - Notes: Fusion endpoint exists and caches results; temporal filters are supported in `memory.search` but not exposed in `/search/fusion`.

- STM→LTM consolidation observable and backups/restores succeed
  - Status: Partial
  - Notes: Consolidation runs and logs; backup/restore not implemented.

---

### Summary of Key Gaps

- Missing endpoints: `system.backup`, `system.restore`, `advanced.analyze_patterns`, `advanced.reindex`.
- Hybrid retrieval not using vector/graph yet; fusion lacks temporal parameters.
- No versioning/re‑embedding/index refresh on `memory.update`; no safe cascade on delete.
- Document retrieval by `path` not supported; analyze lacks concepts/summary/linking output.
- No metrics/dashboards; no backpressure/circuit breakers; minimal input validation.
